  This is ttftot42, a program to faciliate using TrueType fonts on
PostScript interperters with TrueType rasterizer.

  You need the FreeType library to compile and use it.


  TrueType fonts cannot be converted to Type 1 fonts without loss of
quality, since the curves used to describe outlines are incompatible.
Therefore, newer PostScript interpreters (Adobe PostScript since
version 2013, ghostscript since 5.03) include a TrueType rasterizers.
To use a TrueType font with them, they have to be embeded in a
PostScript font dictionary; this format is called Type 42 fonts.

  This program generates such Type 42 fonts from TrueType fonts.  It
can also generate Adobe Font Metrics files (AFM files), including
kerning information.

  Not yet supported are selecting fonts from TrueType Collections (the
first font is used) and the creation of CID keyed fonts from large
TrueType fonts (East Asian or Unicode fonts).
